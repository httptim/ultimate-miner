# Monitoring Module Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The error `attempt to call field 'schedule_repeating_task' (a nil value)` was caused by the monitoring, alerts, and cancellation modules trying to use Core functions that don't exist.

## Changes Made

### 1. Monitoring Module (`/turtle/modules/monitoring.lua`)
- Fixed `State.load("monitoring")` â†’ `State.loadFile("monitoring")`
- Removed calls to non-existent `Core.schedule_repeating_task`
- Added `Monitoring.tick()` function for periodic updates
- Removed calls to non-existent `Core.cancel_task`

### 2. Alerts Module (`/turtle/modules/alerts.lua`)
- Replaced `Core.schedule_repeating_task` with tick-based approach
- Added `Alerts.tick()` function
- Added proper shutdown handling

### 3. Cancellation Module (`/turtle/modules/cancellation.lua`)
- Replaced `Core.schedule_repeating_task` with tick-based approach
- Added `Cancellation.tick()` function
- Fixed immediate task scheduling

## How It Works Now

Instead of relying on Core having a scheduler, these modules now use a tick-based approach:

1. Each module tracks when it last performed its periodic task
2. The `tick()` function checks if enough time has passed
3. If yes, it performs the task and updates the timestamp

## Integration Required

The main turtle program needs to call these tick functions periodically:
```lua
-- In the main loop or event handler:
Monitoring.tick()
Alerts.tick()
Cancellation.tick()
```

## Testing

After updating, the monitoring system should initialize without errors and:
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor health status
- Process alerts
- Handle cancellations

The error reporting system will now properly capture and report any remaining issues.
