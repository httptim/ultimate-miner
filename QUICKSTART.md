# Ultimate Miner Quick Start Guide

## Project Setup Complete! üéâ

You now have a fully structured foundation for developing the Ultimate Miner system. Here's what has been created:

### üìÅ Project Structure
- **Modular architecture** with separate directories for turtle, control, and shared components
- **Clear separation** between mining logic, control interfaces, and shared utilities
- **Organized documentation** in the docs/ directory
- **Testing framework** structure in tests/
- **Example scripts** in examples/

### üìö Documentation Created
1. **ROADMAP.md** - 20-week development plan with detailed phases
2. **PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md** - Complete directory layout and module descriptions  
3. **DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** - Coding standards, patterns, and best practices
4. **API_REFERENCE.md** - Complete module interface specifications
5. **CLAUDE.md** - Development guidance (includes CC:Tweaked doc references)

### üöÄ Next Steps

#### Immediate Development Tasks (Phase 1 - Foundation)

1. **Create Core Utilities Module** (`turtle/modules/core.lua`)
   - Start with vector math functions
   - Implement event system
   - Add logging framework
   - Create common helpers

2. **Implement Basic Movement** (`turtle/modules/navigation.lua`)
   - Safe movement functions
   - Position tracking
   - Fuel monitoring
   - Basic obstacle detection

3. **Set Up State Persistence** (`turtle/modules/state.lua`)
   - Save/load functionality
   - State validation
   - Backup system

4. **Create the Installer** (`installer.lua`)
   - Device detection
   - Module installation
   - Initial configuration

#### Development Workflow

1. **Choose a module** from the roadmap
2. **Review the API** in `docs/api_reference.md`
3. **Check CC:Tweaked docs** in `docs/references.md` for required APIs
4. **Implement following** the patterns in `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
5. **Test thoroughly** both in isolation and integrated

#### Testing Your Code

Since this is for CC:Tweaked, testing happens in Minecraft:

1. **Set up a test world** with turtles and computers
2. **Use the Lua interpreter** for quick tests: `lua` in the turtle/computer
3. **Create test scripts** in the `tests/` directory
4. **Use debug logging** extensively during development

#### Key Implementation Order

Based on dependencies, implement in this order:

1. Core utilities (everything depends on this)
2. State & Config (needed for persistence)  
3. Navigation (required for mining)
4. Inventory (required for mining)
5. Safety (should be integrated early)
6. Mining patterns (after movement works)
7. Network (can be developed in parallel)
8. Control computer (after network works)

### üí° Development Tips

#### Memory Management
- CC:Tweaked has limited memory
- Use circular buffers for history
- Clear unused variables
- Batch operations when possible

#### Error Handling
- Always return `success, error_message`
- Use pcall for risky operations
- Log errors with context
- Provide recovery mechanisms

#### Network Communication  
- Use the "ULTIMATE_MINER_V2" protocol
- Keep messages small
- Batch updates (5-10 second intervals)
- Handle disconnections gracefully

### üéØ First Milestone Goal

**Week 4 Target**: A basic turtle that can:
- Move safely with fuel monitoring
- Mine blocks with ore detection
- Manage inventory with basic classification
- Return home to deposit items
- Persist state across restarts

### üìù Version Control

Remember to:
- Commit working modules frequently
- Tag major milestones
- Document breaking changes
- Keep the installer updated

### ü§ù Getting Help

- Check `docs/references.md` for CC:Tweaked API docs
- Review examples in `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
- Refer to module APIs in `docs/api_reference.md`
- Test incrementally in Minecraft
