# Phase 6 Summary: Network Foundation

## Overview

Phase 6 has successfully implemented the network communication infrastructure for Ultimate Miner, establishing the foundation for multi-turtle coordination and control computer integration.

## Completed Features

### Network Module (`turtle/modules/network.lua`)

1. **Rednet Protocol Implementation**
   - Uses "ULTIMATE_MINER_V2" protocol exclusively
   - Message filtering prevents interference from other programs
   - Support for custom protocols

2. **Modem Detection and Management**
   - Automatic detection of available modems
   - Priority system: Ender modem > Wireless > Wired
   - Graceful fallback when preferred modem unavailable

3. **Connection Management**
   - Connect/disconnect functionality
   - Connection status tracking
   - Automatic timeout detection (30 seconds)

4. **Message System**
   - Send to specific computers
   - Broadcast to all computers
   - Protocol-filtered receiving
   - Message handlers for different message types

5. **Heartbeat System**
   - Automatic heartbeat every 5-10 seconds (configurable)
   - Sends position, fuel, inventory, and task status
   - Maintains connection health

6. **Network Discovery**
   - Service discovery mechanism
   - Find control computers or other services
   - Timeout-based collection of responses

7. **Control Computer Integration**
   - Track control computer ID
   - Targeted status updates
   - Command request/response system

8. **Error Recovery**
   - Reconnection after failures
   - Network state persistence
   - Graceful degradation

## Message Types Implemented

- `turtle_online` - Announces turtle joining network
- `turtle_offline` - Announces turtle leaving network
- `heartbeat` - Regular status updates
- `ping/pong` - Connection testing
- `command` - Control computer commands
- `status_update` - On-demand status reports
- `command_request/response` - Command polling
- `discover/discover_response` - Service discovery

## API Highlights

```lua
-- Basic usage
Network.init()
Network.connect()

-- Send status
Network.sendStatus({
    current_task = "mining",
    blocks_mined = 100
})

-- Register handler
Network.registerHandler("command", function(sender, data)
    -- Handle command
end)

-- Discover services
local services = Network.discover("control_computer")
```

## Testing

- Created comprehensive test suite (`tests/turtle/test_network.lua`)
- 43 tests covering all functionality
- 100% test pass rate
- Tests include edge cases and error conditions

## Integration Points

The Network module is ready to integrate with:
- Control computer for fleet management
- Task assignment system
- Multi-turtle coordination
- Remote monitoring and control

## Next Steps

Phase 7 will build upon this foundation to implement:
- Control computer core functionality
- Fleet management system
- User interface for control computer
- Task assignment and monitoring

## Technical Notes

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Heartbeat intervals optimized for 5-20 turtle fleets
   - Message batching where appropriate
   - Efficient protocol filtering

2. **Reliability Features**
   - Automatic reconnection
   - Timeout handling
   - Graceful degradation without network

3. **Extensibility**
   - Message handler system for custom protocols
   - Service discovery for future expansion
   - Configurable timeouts and intervals

## Code Quality

- Well-documented API
- Consistent error handling
- Modular design following project patterns
- No circular dependencies
- Memory-efficient implementation
