# Getting Started with Ultimate Miner

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

1. On your turtle or computer, run:
```
wget https://github.com/httptim/ultimate-miner/raw/main/installer.lua installer
installer
```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to install the appropriate components

### Manual Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Copy the appropriate folders to your turtle/computer:
   - For turtles: `/turtle/`, `/shared/`
   - For computers: `/control/`, `/shared/`
   - For both: all folders

## First Run

### On a Turtle

1. After installation, run:
```
/turtle/main.lua
```

2. The system will initialize and show the main menu
3. Use "Test Movement" to verify the turtle is working correctly
4. Configure settings as needed

### On a Control Computer

1. After installation, run:
```
/control/main.lua
```

2. The control center will start
3. Turtles will automatically connect when they come online

## Basic Usage

### Turtle Controls

From the main menu:
- **1** - Start Mining (coming soon)
- **2** - Configure Settings
- **3** - Test Movement
- **4** - View Statistics
- **5** - Network Control Mode (coming soon)
- **6** - Exit

### Movement Test Options

- Test basic movements (forward, back, up, down)
- Test turning and facing directions
- Test GPS location (if available)
- Move to specific coordinates
- Return to home position

## Requirements

- CC:Tweaked for Minecraft 1.21.1
- Mining turtle (with pickaxe)
- Fuel in turtle inventory
- Wireless modem for network features (optional)
- GPS satellites for GPS features (optional)

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
- Ensure all files were installed correctly
- Check that the module paths are correct
- Try reinstalling with the installer

### Movement failures
- Check turtle has fuel: `turtle.getFuelLevel()`
- Ensure turtle isn't blocked by blocks
- Verify position isn't outside safety bounds

### GPS not working
- Ensure GPS satellites are set up in your world
- Check wireless modem is attached
- Try GPS calibration from movement test menu
